* Use Wandb for logging                                                                         DONE
* fixed creation of model to be less hard coded. Have a look at unnecessary arguments etc       DONE

* Have a look at what is going on in each training pass                                         DONE
* make test accuracy computation a bit nicer                                                    DONE
* make saving of test samples a bit nicer                                                       DONE
* check if experiment config is logged correctly                                                DONE
* look with more detail into the different forward passes of the model                          DONE
* make sure everything is logged in this repo as in the old repo (fixed_pred_something)         DONE
* try run with github default settings                                                          DONE
* Audio files not saving properly and not sounding properly                                     DONE
* Fix audio file saving name                                                                    DONE
* Fix saved audio file not sounding properly                                                    DONE
    - pre-processed audio files do sound good                                                   DONE
    - can we save files directly again and they still sound good?                               DONE
    - can we save files later in the training loop and they still sound good?                   DONE
    - Problem seem shape-related. Check shapes of tensors that we are trying to save            DONE
* Check distortion loss between generated male and generated female                             DONE
* No difference between fake_male_mel and fake_female_mel. Why?                                 DONE
    * Do we update networks correctly?                                                          DONE
        - Fixed bug using filter_gens learning rate for filter_disc                             DONE
        - Fixed bug with not using conditional information in generative models                 DONE
* Fixed logging stuff                                                                           DONE


* How to improve GAN training:
    - filtered_mel is probably not normalized. Try normalize it! NO Difference                  DONE
    - How do we currently create noise? Uniform or spherically?                                 DONE
    - Look into the modified loss stuff for GANS
    - Apply some sort of batch normalization?
    - What activation functions do we use? Try LeakyReLU
    - What is PixelShuffle and is it something we should use?
    - Label smoothing and occationally flip labels?
    - What is DCGAN and how does hybrid models work?
    - Replay buffer
    - Swap current models of G and D with saved checkpoints of past generations
    -
* try run with paper settings
* read up about GAN-losses
* read up about how GANs generate images

* make sure which values represent what in label/secret and make sure we track them correctly
* ask about frozen_alex_net predictions and ask about target = secret - ones
* what is ngf in mel2audio?

* check order of variables when calculating accuracies for secret_disc
