Metrics:
--------------------------------
filter_gen:
    distortion_loss:    L1-loss, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between real spectrograms and the version where gender has been
                        filtered out. Penalizes filtered spectrograms that look different from the original ones.

    entropy_loss:

    adversarial_loss:   Cross-entropy loss between inverse filter_discs predictions of gender and true gender. This is
                        so that we penalize the filter_gen when it didn't manage to fool the discriminator

    combination:        entropy_loss/adversarial_loss + lambda * ReLU(distortion_loss)^2. Why the relu and square?


filter_disc:
    loss:               Cross-entropy loss between filter_disc predictions of gender and true gender.
                        Should be able to predict real gender of speakers

    accuracy:           How well can filter_disc predict gender from filtered_spectrograms


secret_gen:
    distortion_loss:    L1-loss. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the spectrograms with generated gender and original ones.

    adversarial_loss:   Cross-entropy loss between the secret_discs prediction of gender and the supposedly generated genders

    combination:        Adversarial_loss + lambda * ReLU(distortion_loss)^2. Why the relu and square?


secret_disc:
    real_loss:          Cross-entropy loss between the secret_disc prediction of gender given original data and true gender

    fake_loss:          Cross-entropy loss between the secret_disc prediction of gender given a regenerated gender
                        compared to the true gender

    combined_loss:      Adding the real and fake losses together

    real_accuracy:      How well secret_disc can predict gender from unaltered spectrograms

    fake_accuracy:      How well secret_disc can predict whether the gender is fake in a  spectrograms

    generated_accuracy: How well secret_disc can predict the intented gender of the altered spectrogram


----------------------------------------------------------------
pcgan-run:
    filter_gen:         * adversarial loss is higher than distortion_loss. Meaning harder to fool discriminator than
                        keeping filtered spectrograms close to original ones.
                        * No overfitting

    filter_disc:        * Loss and accuracy is noisy but seem stationary
                        * No sign of overfitting

    secret_gen:         * distortion loss goes down but adversarial loss seem static. Does the generator focus on making
                        spectrograms similar to originals rather than making them hard to predict?

    secret_disc:        * real loss goes down signalling that the model laerns to predict gender
                        * fake loss seem stationary. If it improves on real spectrograms, does it mean that the
                         competition is even?
